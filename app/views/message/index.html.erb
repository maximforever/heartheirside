<div class = "explanation hidden">
    
    <p>We live in opinion bubbles - most of our friends share and reinforce our opinions - in this case, on the election. This cuts us off from understanding the other side and turns politics into sport, where we hate the other candidate just because they're on the other side.</p>

    <p>In addition, the media doesn't do a great job explaining why, in this very close election, so many people are lining up behind the other candiate - when none of our friends seem to.</p>

    <p>I was fed up by being surrounded people who share my opinions, and failing to understand the "other side". So, I build this project so that we could ANONYMOUSLY, DIRECTLY share our political opinions.</p>
